# CPlusPlusProgram

For this project, I was asked ot build a basic banking applicaiton that will be accessed by high school students to get a better
idea of the fiscal responsibility as they watch their potential investments grow. To do so, the application has to show a menu 
allowing the user to input the initial investment amount, monthly deposits, the compounded annual interest, and the amount of 
years. After these user inputs, the applicaiton will calculate their investments and show two columns, one showing the year end 
balance and the second column should show the year-end earned interest if no additional monthly deposits are made.The user then 
has the option to make changes to the amounts deposited, annual interest, and duration of years to see the potential growth. 

Within the project, the syntax and organization of the code helps keep the program easy to read and comprehend for future reference.
The comments found in the code also help explain the programs expectations. In addition to these details, the program runs efficiently
and allows the user to be able to correctly view their contributions and watch their investments grow. In the future, being able to 
debug as I go will help prevent unnecessary time to be wasted on searching for a problem, and instead writing the code correctly.
There can also always be improvements on use of white space and organization!

When writing the code, I found the syntax of writing constructors and destructors to be confusing, but I know with more use and practice
I will be able to understand it better in the future. I will also be sure to watch tutorials and read up more on the sytax styles for
these types of tools to be used within the code to get a better understanding over all. From this project, I will be able to use the 
basic math elemets in other programs regarding banking or fiscal use. In order to keep it readable, I ensured the use of correct white 
space and organization.
